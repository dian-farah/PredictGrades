# PredictGrades

PredictGrades is a data science project aimed to predict students's grade categories for a learning management system (LMS) called Kalboard 360. The data is found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/aljarah/xAPI-Edu-Data) and it consists of 480 students and 16 attributes. Covid-19 increased prevalence of remote learning as it allow learners to learn fast and at their own pace. Methods to track students' progress online is different from physical. Through prediction, educators could give better help to students by early indentification and intervention. The results of my findings can be found [here](https://rpubs.com/Dian/PredictGrades)
